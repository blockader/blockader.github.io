Such architectures consider an image as a sequence of patches and use multiple layers of self-attention and MLP to generate representation for each token. Its token-wise nature raises the question of whether we can apply dense supervision on each of the token to serve purposes such as achieving better accuracy or more efficient training.<br><img align="center" width="1024" height="512" src="/images/transformer.png"><br>Our project explores this idea of dense token supervision for transformer on video action recognition and image classification tasks. We first consider the video action recognition task as the research interest in this area is gradually shifting to fine-grained action recogntion tasks to deal with the huge gap between the success of the state of the art action recogniton models and real-word applications. FineGym[2] is a fine-grained action recogniton dataset that provides multiple levels of supervision for a single video, which is pefectly suitable for our project as we can consider each frame as one token. We also consider the case for single image classification, where we use a pretrained teacher model to provide patch-wise supervision. Our results show that applying dense token supervision to transformers makes it easier for the model to converge to satifying accuracy (less sensensitive to the learning rate), and accelerates the training when trained from scratch.</p><h2 id="Related-Work"><a href="#Related-Work" class="headerlink" title="Related Work"></a><strong>Related Work</strong></h2><p><strong>Vision Transformer</strong> DeTR [3], which is achieving similar performance with other state-of-the art object detection algorithms, is a novel architecture that composed of traditional CNN and transformer. ViT [1] is an image classifier based on transformer and comsumes an divided image of 16 x 16 words. DeiT [4] further improves ViT’s data efficiency by distilling knowledge using a CNN. [5] extends ViT from image classification to action recognition.<br><strong>Action Recognition</strong> Action recognition models take videos as input and predict the corresponding actions (labels). Recent works [6, 7, 8] utilize 2D CNNs structure to extract framewise features and further combined those with a temporal model. It is an improvement compared to the 3D convolution neural networks [9], which has a high complexity and thus computational expensive.<br><strong>Fine-grained Action Recognition</strong> State-of-the-art models have achieved great success in classical action recognition. The focus has been shifted to the fine-grained action recognitions [2,7]. For fine-grained action recogitions, some classes are similar in context but different in some sub-action levels. Compared to the traditional action recognition, models are required to differentiate those minor differences and learn the specific temporal and spatial features. [11] is one of the models, which is based on attention mechanism and semi-supervised learning.  </p><h2 id="Video-Classification-with-Frame-level-Labels"><a href="#Video-Classification-with-Frame-level-Labels" class="headerlink" title="Video Classification with Frame-level Labels"></a><strong>Video Classification with Frame-level Labels</strong></h2><h3 id="Dataset"><a href="#Dataset" class="headerlink" title="Dataset"></a>Dataset</h3><p><strong>FineGym</strong> [2] is an action recognition dataset which contains coarse-to-fine annotations with three levels of labels. The data source is based on the gymnastic videos, which are publicly available on YouTube. The top level corresponds to events such as balance beam or uneven bars. The second level and the third level corresponds to the sub-actions with decreasing granularity.  </p><h3 id="Model"><a href="#Model" class="headerlink" title="Model"></a>Model</h3><p>Introduce our model.<br><img align="center" width="1024" height="512" src="/images/video.png"></p><h3 id="Results"><a href="#Results" class="headerlink" title="Results"></a>Results</h3><p>Show the results.</p><h2 id="Image-Classification"><a href="#Image-Classification" class="headerlink" title="Image Classification"></a><strong>Image Classification</strong></h2><h3 id="Dataset-1"><a href="#Dataset-1" class="headerlink" title="Dataset"></a>Dataset</h3><p>Introduce ImageNet and Places365.</p><h3 id="Model-1"><a href="#Model-1" class="headerlink" title="Model"></a>Model</h3><p>Introduce our model.<br><img align="center" width="1024" height="512" src="/images/image.png"></p><h3 id="Results-1"><a href="#Results-1" class="headerlink" title="Results"></a>Results</h3><p>Show the results.<br><img align="center" width="1024" height="512" src="/images/pretrained.png"><br><img align="center" width="1024" height="512" src="/images/scratch.png"></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Give an overall conclusion, and talk about future steps.</p><h2 id="Supplemental-Materials"><a href="#Supplemental-Materials" class="headerlink" title="Supplemental Materials"></a><strong>Supplemental Materials</strong></h2><h3 id="Presentation-Video"><a href="#Presentation-Video" class="headerlink" title="Presentation Video"></a>Presentation Video</h3><div class="video-container"><iframe   src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ks_YPSJZAGE?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0 frameborder=0 gesture=media allow=encrypted-media allowfullscreen></iframe></div><h3 id="Code"><a href="#Code" class="headerlink" title="Code"></a>Code</h3><p><a href="/files/dense_token.zip">dense_token.zip</a></p><h2 id="References"><a href="#References" class="headerlink" title="References"></a><strong>References</strong></h2><p>[1] Alexey Dosovitskiy, Lucas Beyer, Alexander Kolesnikov, Dirk Weissenborn, Xiaohua Zhai, Thomas Unterthiner, Mostafa Dehghani, Matthias Minderer, Georg Heigold, Sylvain Gelly, et al.
